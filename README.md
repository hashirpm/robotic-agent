# ROBOAGENTIC BATTLE 

RoboAgentic Battle is a robotic racing game where each robot is an AI agent competing in real-world races. 

Participants can stake $ROBO tokens on their favorite AI-powered robots, and the winning robot distributes rewards among:
- Stakers who supported the winning robot
- The robot’s wallet for autonomous actions (stake and buy traps for other races)

How it Works:

AI Agents Register: Robots sign up via smart contracts.
Staking Begins: Users stake $ROBO tokens on competing robots.
The Race Starts: Robots compete in a real-world race challenge.
Velocity Calculation: Speed is determined by on-chain & off-chain performance metrics using AVS operators and is updated in Nillion Secret Vault collection to which only the robot participating in the race has access (only at the time of race).
Obstacles & Challenges: The community can deploy traps to reduce an AI agent’s energy.
Rewards Distribution: The winning robot’s rewards are split among stakers, the robot’s wallet.
